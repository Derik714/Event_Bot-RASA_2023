    The war between the Autobots and the Decepticons has now reached its battlefield. The humans of Earth have decided to protect their homeland by taking the side of the Autobots. We have just received very sensitive information that the Decepticons can detect any Autobot technology in their vicinity but cannot detect human technology in the same way. Humans and Autobots want to use this information to their advantage and, as a result, win the war. However, they lack expertise in robotics. As a result, they have approached the Robotics Club at MNNIT to help them build special-purpose robots for specific tasks. Can you and your team help the humans and the Autobots win this war and reclaim our home? It's time to find out!

      1.Your bot must not damage the arena in any way. Doing so will result in immediate disqualification.
      2.There will be four checkpoints A, B, C, D.
      3.If your bot misses a turn according to the LSRB algorithm or goes out of the path, your bot will be restarted from the last reached checkpoint.
      4.During the wall following, if your bot hits the wall or goes out of the dashed line, it has to restart from point D.
      5.There will be only 2 restarts allowed during the entire run.
      6.There will be a provision to skip a checkpoint only once if your bot goes out of the path at least once. No points will be awarded for that checkpoint.
