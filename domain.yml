    1.This is a team event with a maximum of 4 members and a minimum of 2. Team members can be from any branch.
    2.You are required to build a working robot for any one problem before the deadline. You can contact seniors for any discrepancies or doubts in the problem statement.
    3.You will need to submit an abstract before submitting a solution, in which you will describe your approach to the problem and list all the hardware used.
    4.The decision of the judges will be final and binding. Rules and Regulations.
    5.This is a cumulative scoring event, so you need to perform well in all rounds to win.
    6.ANY FORM OF CODE PLAGIARISM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. If any part of the project is found to be copied, the team will be disqualified immediately.
    7.Do not assume anything in the problem statement by yourself. Contact us to resolve any discrepancies.

    The war between the Autobots and the Decepticons has now reached its battlefield. The humans of Earth have decided to protect their homeland by taking the side of the Autobots. We have just received very sensitive information that the Decepticons can detect any Autobot technology in their vicinity but cannot detect human technology in the same way. Humans and Autobots want to use this information to their advantage and, as a result, win the war. However, they lack expertise in robotics. As a result, they have approached the Robotics Club at MNNIT to help them build special-purpose robots for specific tasks. Can you and your team help the humans and the Autobots win this war and reclaim our home? It's time to find out!

      1.Your bot must not damage the arena in any way. Doing so will result in immediate disqualification.
      2.There will be four checkpoints A, B, C, D.
      3.If your bot misses a turn according to the LSRB algorithm or goes out of the path, your bot will be restarted from the last reached checkpoint.
      4.During the wall following, if your bot hits the wall or goes out of the dashed line, it has to restart from point D.
      5.There will be only 2 restarts allowed during the entire run.
      6.There will be a provision to skip a checkpoint only once if your bot goes out of the path at least once. No points will be awarded for that checkpoint.

      1.The task performed by your bot must be automated, which means that after you start your bot once, you cannot make any changes in it,
       and it should complete the specified task on its own.
      2.Your bot must use a minimum of 2 sensors (motor as well), Arduino board, and should work on regular power supply.

     1.Focus on making the bot durably and your code well commented. Your bot should not stop working on slightly bad handling.
     2.The main motive of Bot-Rush 2k23 is to help you develop an interest in robotics and introduce you to your first hardware project.
     3.The Basic/Advanced features are to guide you on your theme. You are free to add more features from your side which would enhance the quality of the bot. You would be judged on your creativity,
      the functionality of your bot. Any use of extra sensors/hardware should be informed beforehand.
     4.Participate in the team as it will make you a team player and will be helpful in the future.
     5.Note for first-time developers/beginners: Your focus should be to complete the bot in the given time.
